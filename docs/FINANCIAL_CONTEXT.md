## 📊 Spending Analysis Journey

### The Discovery Process

**Initial Analysis (Incorrect):**
- Appeared to be spending $927/day
- This included credit card PAYMENTS, not actual spending

**Key Realization:**

- The $927/day was payments + transfers, not lifestyle expenses

**Actual Spending Pattern:**
- Real credit card purchases: 371 transactions over 90 days
- Total actual spending: $27,150 over 90 days
- BUT this includes one-time purchases:
  - Camera gear (OC Cameras): $2,252

## 💭 Important Context Notes

### About the Spending Analysis
- Initial analysis was misleading due to analyzing checking account payments vs actual credit card spending
- The real spending pattern is on credit cards (positive amounts = purchases)
- Checking account shows PAYMENTS to credit cards (which looked like huge expenses)
- This caused the incorrect "$927/day" spending estimate

### About the Loan
- The $20,000 wire transfer on Oct 16, 2025 is a LOAN, not income
- Used to refinance/consolidate credit card debt
- $2,000/month payment for ~10 months
- Smart move to reduce interest rates
- After payoff, frees up $2K/month for house savings

### About Investments
- Just started investing in Robinhood (July-Aug 2025)
- Total invested: ~$3,000 (not $2,905 in 90 days)
- Good habit to continue after house purchase

### About LA Housing Market
- Median home: $1.2M (not $500K-650K)
- Need significantly higher income OR
- Consider Inland Empire/condos OR
- Plan to trade up over time
