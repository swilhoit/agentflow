# ✅ Discretionary Budget Tracking - SETUP COMPLETE

## 🎉 What Just Changed

Your budget alerts now track **ONLY discretionary/lifestyle spending** - the stuff that gets out of hand!

### ✅ Tracked Against Your $470/week Budget:
- 🍽️ **Food & Dining** (restaurants, groceries, bars, delivery)
- 🍺 **Entertainment** (bars, events, shows, activities)
- 🚗 **Transportation** (Uber, Lyft, Waymo, parking, gas)
- 🛍️ **Shopping** (Amazon, retail, clothing)
- ✈️ **Travel** (hotels, Airbnb, flights)
- 🏋️ **Fitness** (gym, sports)
- 💵 **General purchases**

### 💼 Tracked Separately (Work-Related):
- 💻 **Tech/Software** (Claude AI, Cursor, Figma, etc.)
- 📱 **Phone bills** (AT&T)
- 🏢 **Office expenses**
- 🌐 **Internet/utilities**

Work expenses show up in daily updates but **DON'T count against your budget**.

## 🎯 To Save Money

If you want to build savings faster, consider these budget targets:

### Moderate Savings Mode
```bash
WEEKLY_BUDGET=420  # Cut $50/week = $200/month savings
```

### Aggressive Savings Mode
```bash
WEEKLY_BUDGET=375  # Cut $95/week = $380/month savings
```

### Extreme Savings Mode
```bash
WEEKLY_BUDGET=330  # Cut $140/week = $560/month savings
```

**Where to cut:**
- Reduce dining out from $73/meal → $40/meal
- Cook at home more (saves $100-150/week)
- Combine Uber trips (saves $10-15/week)
- Wait 24hr before impulse purchases (saves $20/week)
